Simple Ajax Demo for Google App Engine Python.  No javascript libraries, no template engines.

The Post data is hardcoded in script.js, so there are no buttons or input elements to deal with, although these can
be added with ease.

The directory structure is accounted for in app.yaml, so this app should work as-is if your structure is set up the same way.

Tested in Firefox and Chrome.
